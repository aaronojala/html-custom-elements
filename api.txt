1. REST API: Explain in your own words
a. what does it mean and how does it work
b. differences of GET / POST verbs

a. 
REST API is a design pattern for APIs. When the REST API is called it will transfer a 
representation of the state of the requested resource. Usually this state representation is in a JSON format
cant also be in other formats. When a client calls the server with an API, this is influenced by the endpoint and 
HTTP method. The most common HTTP methods are GET, POST, PUT and DELETE. 

b. GET verb indicates that we want to get the state of the object we are requesting. For example if we would go to
a certain users Facebook profile we would GET the state of that user. GET request is only used to request data.
POST method on the other hand can send data to the server. This data can be used to create or update.
